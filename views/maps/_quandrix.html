<p class="start"><strong>The Arithmodrome:</strong>
    The whole Quandrix campus is alive with dynamic sculptures made of water behaving in odd ways: cube-shaped fountains, arcing squeducts that flow through the air, towers of solid seeming water. One such water structure and the most impressive of them all is the Arithmodrome. This ten feet wide cube is constantly changing its shape in interesting ways, still inspiring mage-students to this day with new ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Torus Hall:</strong>
    The central hall of Quandrix lies at the end of a geometric series of walkways, spanning over a deep chasm, terminating at ascending ramps to the towering building. The inside of the hall is ever evolving, the architecture being mapped to an ever-changing three-dimensional grid. There are those who insist that you shouldn't linger for too long inside this hall, for its geometry might eventually turn itself inside out while you are still inside. But this is, of course, just mathematical superstition.</p>
<p><strong>The Cultivarium:</strong>
    To the east of the campus lies an eye-popping, sun-drenched garden of spiralling, cyclical plants and fractalized animals. Quandrix faculty members have repeatedly taught growth spells in this part of campus, and over the centuries, the Cultivarium has come to intensify any growth spells cast within it.</p>
