<p class="start"><strong>The Dramarium:</strong>
    This facility is where Silverquill students train in physical performances, such as fitness, dance, or martial arts. The Gray Room is a series of rooms with everything you would need to prepare yourself for any situation, such as hair and makeup salons, voice rehearsal booths, mirrored rehearsal spaces, and spa facilities. There is even a sensory deprivation chamber in the back for mage-students who want complete silence in which to meditate.</p>
<p><strong>Grandloft Hall:</strong>
    The central and main Silverquill building is Grandloft Hall, a vast space with shafts of light streaking in from he enchanted windowpanes far above. Grandloft teems with balconies, loges, daises, and other spaces were orators can perform their craft. Here enchanted spotlights automatically focus on any mage using powerful magic. Just be careful so no inklings pull a prank on you!</p>
<p><strong>The Rose Stage:</strong>
    A beautiful song backed with a choir of enchanted instruments, a rousing monologue held with the most intense passion, a gut-wrenching improvised comedy play about the university's mascots, or just a honour duel between mage-students. The Rose Stage is the place to go for all matter of performances. Performers from every college dream of using the stage's many tools for their own acts.</p>
